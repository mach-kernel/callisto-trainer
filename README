This is another trainer that was released a short time after "David's Trainer". It's also written in VC++/.NET with ASM snippets here and there, but this one contains its own authentication module & DLL loader for injecting the trainer into the process. At the time it worked on all available Windows platforms that were capable of running the game itself. 

This project also proudly uses the following other software projects (<3):
Tab Control EX: http://dotnetrix.co.uk/controls.htm
DLLInjector (integrated in loader package): http://dllinjector.sourceforge.net/

Happy hacking!
